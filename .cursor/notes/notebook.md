# Rehab Estimator - Development Notebook

## Project Overview
Building a sophisticated real estate rehab estimation tool that provides strategic insights, not just cost calculations. The tool will help investors make data-driven decisions about renovation scopes, priorities, and ROI optimization.

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Architecture
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for modern React development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **shadcn/ui** for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Zustand** for state management (chosen over Redux for simplicity)
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for form validation
- **Supabase** for backend services (auth, database, real-time)

### State Management Strategy
- Using Zustand with persistence for complex state
- Local state for simple UI interactions
- React Hook Form for form state management
- Computed state for calculations and summaries

### Component Structure
- Step-by-step wizard interface
- Reusable components with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Sidebar summary that updates in real-time
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

## Technical Insights

### Form Validation Strategy
- Using Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Cross-field validation (e.g., ARV > purchase price)
- Custom validation rules for business logic

### State Persistence
- Zustand persistence for draft saving
- Selective persistence to avoid storing sensitive data
- Automatic recovery of user progress

### Performance Considerations
- Selector hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading of complex components
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Debounced calculations for expensive operations

### UI/UX Decisions
- Step-by-step wizard for complex workflow
- Real-time sidebar updates
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components

## Business Logic Implementation

### ARV Calculation
- Market-based pricing with property type multipliers
- Regional adjustments (placeholder for now)
- Random variation for realistic estimates
- Validation against purchase price

### Cost Calculations
- Material vs labor cost breakdown
- Contingency calculations (10% default)
- Category-based cost aggregation
- Budget usage tracking

### ROI Analysis
- Potential profit calculations
- ROI percentage calculations
- Market comparison insights
- Investment strategy recommendations

## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables
- `rehab_projects` - Main project data
- `property_assessments` - Room condition assessments
- `rehab_scope_items` - Individual scope items
- `market_comparables` - Market data for insights
- `rehab_recommendations` - AI-generated recommendations

### Relationships
- One-to-many: Project to assessments, scope items, comparables
- Many-to-many: Scope items to dependencies
- Hierarchical: Categories to subcategories

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) for user data isolation
- Authentication required for all operations
- Proper validation on both client and server

## Future Enhancements

### AI Integration
- Market analysis for ARV calculations
- Smart scope recommendations
- Risk assessment
- Contractor matching

### Advanced Features
- Photo analysis for condition assessment
- 3D property visualization
- Contractor bid management
- Cost database with regional pricing

### Analytics
- Portfolio performance tracking
- ROI analysis across projects
- Market trend analysis
- Success rate optimization

## Lessons Learned

### TypeScript Benefits
- Catching errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

### shadcn/ui Advantages
- Consistent design system
- Accessible components out of the box
- Easy customization
- Good documentation

### Zustand Simplicity
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Easy to understand and debug
- Good performance with selectors
- Built-in persistence support

## Development Tips

### Component Development
- Start with TypeScript interfaces
- Use React Hook Form for complex forms
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states early

### State Management
- Keep state as flat as possible
- Use selectors for derived state
- Implement optimistic updates
- Handle loading and error states

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for calculation functions
- Integration tests for form flows
